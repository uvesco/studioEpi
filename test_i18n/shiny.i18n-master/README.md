shiny.i18n
==========

Shiny applications internationalisation made easy!

Actually, you can use **shiny.i18n** as a standalone R package - shiny app is just a perfect usecase example.

Using it is very simple: just prepare your translation files in one of the supported formats, read them into your app using user-friendly **shiny.i18n** interface and surround your expressions to translate by a translator tag. Thanks to that your app will remain neat and readible.

For more informations check the **Example** section below!

Change languages and formats easy with shiny.i18n.
